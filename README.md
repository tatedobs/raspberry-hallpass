# piPass
Used to control a raspberry pi device with a NFC/RFID controller breakout board. Used as a digital hallpass, that keeps track of id numbers in assocation with student names, and records the name, date, check out time, check in time, and time gone everytime a student leaves the room.

The code shouldn't work if run in its current state, as I have edited the authorize.py file to not hold the information to access my google account.
